# Changelog

All notable changes to ComicArc are documented here.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Series View
- Library now defaults to a series card view — one card per series, grouped by character and run
- Each card shows the cover of the first issue, character name, series name, issue count, and a Done/Reading badge
- Click any series card to see all issues inside
- Breadcrumb navigation to jump back to the series grid
- Toggle between series view and flat all-comics view

### Library Improvements
- Series names now reflect the actual run name only (e.g. "New 52" instead of "Superman — New 52") — character context is shown separately on the card
- Character field extracted from folder structure and stored per comic for accurate grouping
